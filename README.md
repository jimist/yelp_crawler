## Yelp London's Coffeshops and Restaurants

### Introduction

this crawler was initially developed to crawl **Yelp London's Coffeshops and Restaurants**

The crawler was mostly developed By [Mr. Aliraza Imani](https://linkedin.com/in/alireza-imani) and I (@jeemist) supervised the development process for keeping the project structure proffesional and easy to scale

We **do not take responsibility** for any harmful usage of this repository considering that our main purpose for fetching Yelp's data was for academic research in Machine Learning Field

### A guide through our code

If you want to use this code, make sure of making a virtual enviroment under the *env* directory

our main configs are under config.py file and our database models are **Models** directory

to start using make sure you set your database authentication information in config.py and run create_database.py

In order to keep this projec scalable we made the **Crawler** directory for our different Crawlers *(based on **Adapter Design Pattern**)*

If you wanted to develop this repository for your own, try to keep your database code in DataProviders directory's files
